## About
Our geoportal is a web application that can be used to store, share, find and access geospatial data. The tool is based on Oskari and can be used to capture or upload spatial data. Both tools Urban Hotspots and Urban Performance run inside the Geoportal as plug-ins. And can be used to perform analysis right in the Geoportal.

### Urban Performance
To analyze possible future scenarios, we created Urban Performance. A tool that, through the analysis of geospatial data, forecasts the city’s future performance and helps us in choosing the best path forward.

### Urban Hotspots
Urban Hotspots is a web application that uses multicriteria analysis techniques for agile spatial analysis. With SuitAbility users can create heat maps of access to urban services within minutes or find optimal locations for a specific activity within a city.

## User Manuals
User manuals explain all functionalities in the UPT (Urban Performance and Urban Hotspots) in order to run evaluations.
